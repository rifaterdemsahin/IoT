To enhance user interactions within this dialysis clinic IoT system, several user interfaces (UIs) are essential across different components. Each interface serves specific users, including clinicians, IT administrators, and support staff.

### **1. Clinician Dashboard**
   - **Platform**: Power BI or a custom web application.
   - **Functionality**: Provides real-time patient health data, dialysis session status, alerts for abnormalities (e.g., abnormal blood pressure), and summary reports.
   - **UI Features**: Interactive charts, patient list filters, alert notifications, and session history.
   - **User Experience**: Designed for quick, visual access to vital signs and session data for monitoring patients efficiently.

### **2. IT & Admin Dashboard**
   - **Platform**: Azure Monitor or a custom management console.
   - **Functionality**: Displays the health of IoT devices, network connectivity, data transmission status, and system alerts for troubleshooting.
   - **UI Features**: Device status indicators, error logs, diagnostic tools, and remote control options.
   - **User Experience**: Built for monitoring infrastructure and addressing any technical issues, ensuring minimal downtime.

### **3. Data Storage and Analytics Interface**
   - **Platform**: Azure Synapse Analytics and Power BI.
   - **Functionality**: Allows users to query historical data for trends, compliance audits, and patient health insights over time.
   - **UI Features**: Data query builder, visualization tools (graphs, charts), and export options for detailed reporting.
   - **User Experience**: Enables data analysis for long-term research and regulatory reporting needs, tailored for data scientists and clinical researchers.

### **4. Patient Data Access Portal**
   - **Platform**: Web-based patient portal or mobile app.
   - **Functionality**: Patients or their caregivers can view past session data, access reports, and receive notifications about their health.
   - **UI Features**: Login interface, session summaries, downloadable reports, and communication options to contact healthcare providers.
   - **User Experience**: Provides an intuitive, secure way for patients to track their health and access their own records.

### **5. Alert Management and Notification Interface**
   - **Platform**: Integrated with Azure Monitor, available as a mobile or desktop interface.
   - **Functionality**: Configures and sends real-time alerts to clinicians or technical staff based on thresholds (e.g., device malfunction, vital signs alert).
   - **UI Features**: Configurable alert thresholds, notification history, and options to trigger SMS, email, or push notifications.
   - **User Experience**: Ensures timely alerts and updates for healthcare staff, reducing reaction time in critical situations.

### **6. API Management Console**
   - **Platform**: Azure API Management portal.
   - **Functionality**: Provides an interface for third-party integrations and API configuration, access control, and usage tracking.
   - **UI Features**: API keys management, role-based access, request logging, and analytics for API usage.
   - **User Experience**: Facilitates controlled and secure API access for external applications or health systems interacting with clinic data.

### **7. Security and Compliance Dashboard**
   - **Platform**: Azure Security Center and Active Directory Admin Center.
   - **Functionality**: Centralized view of security and compliance statuses, access logs, and policy compliance audits.
   - **UI Features**: Compliance reports, real-time security alerts, identity management, and role configuration.
   - **User Experience**: Ensures the system complies with healthcare regulations and allows admins to enforce access control and monitor security policies.

These user interfaces ensure efficient workflows, secure access, and robust data visibility for all involved in the clinic’s IoT-based monitoring system, supporting both clinical and technical requirements.
