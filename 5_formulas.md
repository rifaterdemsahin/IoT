---

### **6. Azure Functions (Serverless Logic) ‚öôÔ∏è**

**Prompt**: 
"Design Azure Functions to automate backend processes, such as triggering new orders when patient metrics exceed specific thresholds. Set up event-driven workflows to notify the Order Management System (OMS) when dialysis sessions complete or maintenance is required. How will we handle error logging and retry mechanisms for reliable function execution?"
