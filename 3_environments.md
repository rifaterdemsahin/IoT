### **5. Data Storage (Azure Data Lake / Cosmos DB / SQL Database) üíæ**
   - **Development Environments**: [Azure Data Lake](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-lake-storage/) for raw data storage; [Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/) or [SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/) for structured data.
   - **Tools**: [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/), [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/), or [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) for managing data and queries.
   - **Data Compliance**: Use [Azure Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview) to enforce data retention and compliance with healthcare standards, including automated backup configurations.

### **6. Azure Functions (Serverless Logic) ‚öôÔ∏è**
   - **Development Environment**: [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) runtime with support for C#, JavaScript, or Python, depending on the logic requirements.
   - **Tools**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) or the [Azure Functions CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local).
   - **Automation**: Use Function Apps to link with the Order Management System (OMS) for automation based on real-time events.

### **7. Power BI / Azure Synapse Analytics üìà**
   - **Development Environment**: [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) for report creation, and [Synapse Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/synapse-analytics/) for complex data queries and integration.
   - **Data Models**: Build Power BI datasets and integrate with Azure Synapse for a seamless experience in visualizing data.
   - **Scheduled Reporting**: Configure scheduled refresh in Power BI or Synapse for near real-time reporting.

### **8. Azure Monitor & Alerts üö®**
   - **Monitoring Tools**: [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/monitor/) and [Azure Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) for comprehensive monitoring of IoT devices and system health.
   - **Development Environment**: Azure CLI and Azure Monitor dashboard to set up alerts and diagnostics.
   - **Alert Configuration**: Define alerts for device health, network connectivity, and abnormal vitals using pre-configured rules and thresholds.

### **9. Azure API Management üîê**
   - **Development Environment**: [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/) with policies for rate limiting, caching, and access control.
   - **Security**: OAuth, token-based authentication, and [Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) for role-based access to APIs.
   - **Logging**: Enable API request and response logging for auditing and compliance.

### **10. Security and Compliance (Azure Policy / Azure Active Directory) üõ°Ô∏è**
   - **Security Tools**: [Azure Active Directory (AAD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) for identity management, [Azure Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview), and [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/) for encryption key management.
   - **Development Environment**: Azure Portal for policy management, Azure CLI for configuring access controls.
   - **Compliance Monitoring**: Use [Azure Security Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/security-center/) for auditing and enforcing compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, or other regulatory standards.

### **Summary Flow**

1. **On-Premises Devices**: IoT Edge devices collect data and send it to the IoT Gateway.
2. **IoT Gateway**: Aggregates and pre-processes data before securely pushing it to the Azure IoT Hub.
3. **Azure IoT Hub**: Manages data ingestion, device provisioning, and secure communications.
4. **Data Processing**: Azure Stream Analytics processes the incoming data for insights and alerts.
5. **Data Storage**: Data is stored in Azure Data Lake, Cosmos DB, or SQL Database for historical and structured access.
6. **Automation & Integration**: Azure Functions automate responses and integrate data with OMS.
7. **Visualization & Reporting**: Power BI and Synapse Analytics offer dashboards and reports.
8. **Monitoring & Alerts**: Azure Monitor and Alerts ensure system health and notify staff of issues.
9. **API Management**: Exposes and secures data access for external systems.
10. **Security & Compliance**: Azure AD and Azure Policy enforce access control and compliance with data protection standards. 

This architecture combines real-time data collection, secure cloud processing, and automated responses to support a robust, compliant dialysis monitoring system.
